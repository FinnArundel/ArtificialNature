            <p>In week one we were given an overview of the studio, which included a slideshow presentation by Miriam about design activism and herself. We then discussed different methods of activism and their effectiveness.
            <br>
            <br>
             One of the examples that was shown during this presentation that really resonated with me was Helen Storey’s <a href="https://www.dress4ourtime.org/thedress" target="_blank">"Dress For Our Time"</a>, and the data-visualisation done by <a href="https://holition.com/" target="_blank">Holition</a>. To draw attention to the global refugee crisis, the collabosrative work utilises projection-mapping and data-visualisation of UNHCR statistics. The use of contemporary technology is something I am interested in using for my own major project.
             <br>
             <img src="images/week 1/1.jpg" alt="">
             <br>
             We then used Miro to comment on existing campaigns, as well as adding our own images from campaigns we have found interesting. Separating into groups regarding specific social issues, we organised our thoughts and discussed the first assignment.

            <p>
            Week two began with groups creating word clouds relevant to their area of interest. This helped highlight certain issues within the area at large what would be worth researching for the first assignment. A word cloud I generated from an article called <a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-change-how-bad-could-the-future-be-if-we-do-nothing-159665" target="_blank">"Climate Change: how bad could the future be if we do nothing?"</a> by The Conversation helped visualise key words around the issue of climate change. I was surprised to see the biggest word was “people”, this helped me narrow my field of focus down to the human impact of the climate crisis.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 2/1.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            Then as a group we began to fill out a sample research framework with subtopics, contexts, sources, along with actors who work within our chosen fields and the effectiveness of their campaigns.
            <br>
            <br>
            I chose to research <a href="https://forensic-architecture.org/" target="_blank">Forensic Architecture</a> and the effectiveness of their campaigns. Forensic Architecture is a research agency that utilises modern technologies and techniques in their investigations of human rights violations against those affected by conflict, police brutality, border regimes, and environmental violence. Their work is often very direct in its effectiveness, with their findings being presented in courtrooms and inquiries, as well as gallery spaces.

            <h1>03</h1>
            <p>
            In week three we planned further in our groups regarding our presentation of Assignment One.
            <br>
            <br>
            In regard to my major assignment I have narrowed my field of focus down to the impact of climate change on humans. This includes the relationship between human rights and climate change, and the obligation of governments around the world to uphold the human rights of individuals most at risk, this often being indigenous, minority, poor, and elderly peoples.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the methodology of my major assignment I have considered a number of formats. Inspired by the exhibition <a href="https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/cloudstudies" target="_blank">"Cloud Studies"</a> by Forensic Architecture and the agency’s other work I have considered creating an exhibition style collecting of stories of those affected by climate change. This collection could also work on a web-based platform, such as Nina Gibbes’ research project <a href="https://sittingwiththemess.work/EXEGESIS-NINA-GIBBES" target="_blank">"Sitting With The Mess"</a>, or as a publication. The format would work well for delivering a personal message to the audience, which we had previously noted as an effective campaign technique for creating change. The main problem I see achieving this outcome is acquiring the information needed, either through interviews or other means. Apart from the fact interviewing people definitely isn’t in my skill set, this work could take the bulk of the time and subtract from my design.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 3/1.jpg" alt="">
            <br>    
            Another format I plan to look further into is data-visualisation for installations or screen art. Inspired by Alsino Skowronnek’s work <a href="https://alsino.io/breaking-the-pattern-data-driven-art-installation/" target="_blank">"Breaking the pattern"</a>, this format has the possibility to transform large amounts of climate data into art. Visualisation of the data allows for greater accessibility to an otherwise overwhelming abundance of facts and statistics, which is one of the key problems I see in today’s attitude towards the climate crisis.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 3/2.jpg" alt="">
            <br>   
            During this week I have also been reading Alice Rawsthorn’s <a href="https://viceversaartbooks.com/items/design-as-an-attitude/" target="_blank">"Design as an Attitude"</a>, in which she focuses on design’s power in addressing social challenges (ecological, financial, etc). The book references a large number of designers and design projects that are tackling current social, political, and ecological crises.

            <p>
            In this week’s class we presented Assignment One. I talked about climate change’s impact on humans and human rights, referencing Forensic Architecture’s <a href="https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/environmental-racism-in-death-alley-louisiana" target="_blank">"Environmental Racism in Death Alley", Louisiana</a> as a case study. FA’s use of web-platforms was a point of interest I raised, as they are efficient at spreading a message to a large number of people. I plan to look into this method more for my own project.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 4/1.png" alt="">
            <br> 
            Two things that I have read this week and found interesting have been Libby Marrs’ essay <a href="https://libbymarrs.net/post-authentic-sincerity/" target="_blank">“Post-Authentic Sincerity, a Premium Generic Essay”</a> and Jacob Lindgren’s article <a href=" https://walkerart.org/magazine/jacob-lindgren-graphic-designs-factory-settings#_ftn16" target="_blank">“Graphic Design’s Factory Settings”</a>. Both texts comment on the role of the designer in a capitalist system. Lindgren’s work is a critique of design establishments, writing “Design education not only teaches its technical and historical canon, or how to design, but more importantly teaches students how to be designers in society and in relation to capital”. Marrs, references Lindgren, also critiques the role of the designer in the machine of capitalism, as well as breaking down the false authenticity of the Hipster and marketing targeting the group. Marrs’ also writes about normcore, the antithesis of hipster culture, and how it can be utilised in graphic design through a “Premium-Generic” style, which sincerely embraces the defaults in an attempt to optimise the labour of the designer.
            <br>
            <br>  
            This week I have been looking further into data-visualisations. I think this could be an effective way of communicating the information that often gets lost in the overwhelming amount of data and statistics relating to the climate crisis. Georgia Lupi’s work <a href="http://giorgialupi.com/the-room-of-change" target="_blank">"The Room of Change"</a> is a data-visualisation illustrating how multiple aspects of our environment have changed over the past century and how they will change in the future.
            <br>
            <br>    
            For my own project I have decided to use the new <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/" target="_blank">IPCC report</a> as the basis for the visualisations. There are two approaches to the visualisation of this data I am considering. The first option is to utilise the csv data files supplied on the IPCC website, this option will transform the raw data into visuals and/or sounds to be displayed in large format, either through projection or screen. The other option would be a language analysis approach, in which the entire 1300 pages of the report will be analysed with a language processing algorithm to create some sort of visualisation. One example of this type of work is the art installation <a href="https://vimeo.com/113240712" target="_blank">"Moveable Type"</a> by Mark Hansen & Ben Rubin completed for The New York Times in 2007. The piece displays fragments of the Time’s back catalogue on small screens mounted in a grid layout on the walls. The piece shows how typography and data-art can be combined.

            <p>
            In this week’s class we first attempted to answer a number of question surrounding our selected issue. My issue being climate change I established that a barrier that solutions face is a lack of policy from governments and perhaps a small section of the population that believes that the impacts of climate change exist outside their realm of influence and responsibility. This section of the population will become my audience. This audience’s dreams and opinions are often orientated by an extremely select collectivism, which is often expressed through a “family first” approach to life. Their perceptions are shaped through an exposure to corporate media as well as a nostalgia for a past and a fear of change and big spending. They are most likely to change their actions when an issue impacts themselves or an immediate loved one. The second half of the class was dedicated to further ideation on our major assignments. Including the methods and mediums which we plan to utilise to convey our message.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 5/1.png" alt="">   
            <br> 
            This week I have been researching possible themes/narratives for my project. The first idea is a narrative of artificial nature or the corruption of nature. This could include the juxtaposition of nature and the effects of climate change, the digital imitation of nature, the digital destruction and manipulation of nature, or something else. This idea could utilise satellite imagery like the work <a href="https://alsino.io/google-earth-vacationist-experimental-satellite-imagery-distortion/" target="_blank">“Google Earth Vacationist”</a> by Alsino Skowronnek, or landscape photography. The benefit of the theme is the literal showing of nature which would immediately link back to the issue of climate change for most people. Below is Alex McCullough and Noah Baker's album design for Biosphere's <a href="https://biosphere.bandcamp.com/album/angels-flight" target="_blank">Angel's Flight</a>.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 5/2.jpg" alt="">   
            <br> 
            Another idea that I could continue with is a purely graphic approach. An example of this approach is some of the work of <a href="https://www.ryojiikeda.com/project/testpattern/" target="_blank">Ryoji Ikeda</a>, in which he utilises black and white with basic shapes and patterns. This work is more abstract and runs the risk of the message being lost on the audience, which is one of the main challenges I see moving forward. With such important subject I want to do justice to the issue and not simplify it down into visuals that don’t translate the significance of the report. 
            <br>   
            <br>
            Throughout the week I have been looking through the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf" target="_blank">ICPP Summary for Policymakers Report</a>, which has 10 figures and available open-source data. The data points I have narrowed my focus down to is future emissions estimates in figure 4a, and global temperature, sea level, and ocean pH estimates in figure 8. These four data-sets will let me to break up my work into four chapters, allowing for a flowing narrative in the final piece.

            <h1>06</h1>
            <p>During the break I read Ruben Pater’s book <a href="http://thepoliticsofdesign.com/about-the-book" target="_blank">“The Politics of Design”</a>. The book primarily demonstrates the problems that designers face when communicating across borders and cultures. It highlights the importance and responsibility of designer’s creating inclusive works. The book attempts to challenge the cultural bias evident in symbols, maps, photography, typography and colours, imploring designers to question standards and subvert traditional systems.
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 6/1.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            One project of Pater’s that I found practically interesting is his <a href="http://www.dronesurvivalguide.org/" target="_blank"> Drone Survival Guide</a> . The drone imagery of the foldable poster mimics overhead bird silhouettes, referencing the fact that the knowledge humans once had for our natural environment has been replaced by a knowledge of technology. Through this work Pater argues that technology has become our natural habit, and that drones are becoming ubiquitous in this new habitat. Drone’s high definition cameras along with its ability to stay in the air longer than any manned aircraft allows for constant surveillance like never before. Pater mentions in his <a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=Drone-Survival-Guide" target="_blank">blog post</a> about the project that with the combination of Artificial Intelligence we may find ourselves in state of total surveillance in which algorithms decide who is and who is not a target.

            <br>
            Throughout the week I have also began experimenting with using data in TouchDesigner. Using the raw data file from figure 1 of the IPCC SPM report (global average surface temperature since 1850) I have been able to get a linear output of the temperature over time. Using Google Earth for arial imagery I was able to begin visualising how this data could possibly effect the environment. The example below uses the data to vertically displace the image.

            <h1>07</h1>
            <p>During week seven’s class we presented our project proposals. It was very interesting to see what other people have been working on and are planning to accomplish by the end of the semester. I presented to the class my own proposal for the data-visualisation installation I have written about previously. My presentation included considerations about format, target audience, methodology and anticipated impact. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Following on from last weeks’ preliminary experimentations with TouchDesigner I have shown outcomes to my friends and family in order to gather feedback. The most important feedback I got was that the visuals didn’t take sense without any context. This is one of the problems with data-visualisations I highlighted in my project proposal. To address this I plan to add some typographic elements to the work, including the numeral data itself and description of the data. 
            <br>
            <img src="images/week 7/1.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            Another piece of feedback I received was that there was a lack of sound. I can address this by either adding already existing music or creating my own data-sonification from the data I am already using. With only a relatively short amount of time left until the end of semester I think that using existing music would be preferable, although I will research further into data-sonification as I think it would really add something special to the work. A example I really enjoy is <a href="https://vimeo.com/563641014" target="_blank">Brian Eno’s data-sonification</a> for Forensic Architecture’s work <a href="https://www.digitalviolence.org/#/platform" target="_blank">Digital Violence</a>. Eno is a legend of ambient music, he uses his skills to craft a atmospheric representation of the wealth of information gathered by FA and their collaborators. If I was to create audio for my installation, I would hope for it to have a similar unnerving quality.

            <p>After the feedback I received last week concerning the lack of context surrounding the visuals I have implemented a typographic display to overlay on the visuals. The graphic is inspired by military HUDs (Head-up Displays), it effectively communicates the data source and information. Showing the improved visuals to my parents, they were both able to recognise and understand the information I was trying to get across. My dad also was able to recognise it related to the issue of climate change even without the graphics on first viewing of the project, which was very good. I have designed the graphics in TouchDesigner so I will be able to have the data change as it affects the visuals.

            <img src="images/week 8/3.jpg" alt="">

            The work <a href="https://anthroposphere.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Anthroposphere</a> by Daniel and Michael Kotsimbos, is an algorithmic artwork that converts Melbourne’s ambient air quality data into sound. Researching more into data-sonification I reached out to ask <a href="https://danielkotsimbos.com/" target="_blank">Daniel</a> about his process and for his suggestions. They utilised <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a> for their work but suggested using TouchDesigner and Ableton. This way I would be able to utilise the same data and timing that I am using for my visuals. I have had some experience with Ableton in the past but decided to follow a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4PHD6lp_gQ&t=276s" target="_blank">tutorial</a> in order to create the music and then later change parameters of the instruments with TouchDesigner.

            <br>
            I have finalised and organised by data I plan to use in TouchDesigner. I have made it so it takes around 60 seconds to go through the data for each data-set. I plan to separate each data-set with around 5-10 seconds by silence/stillness, but I am yet to figure out how to achieve this in TouchDesigner.

            <p>This week I was really limited in what I was able to achieve due to a technical problem I faced in TouchDesigner. I was stuck trying to figure out how I will be able to connect all the data together, with 10 seconds before and after each data set. I eventually stopped trying to figure it out myself and turned to the online <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/touchdesignerhelp" target="_blank">TouchDesigner communities </a> on Discord and Facebook for help and soon found the solution to my problem. This little experience really showed me the power of working collaboratively as well as the power of these online communities.

            <h1>10</h1>
            <p>After the roadblock of last week I was able to accomplish much more this week. The compilation of the data meant that I was able to easily use feed the values into Ableton through TouchDesigner. I used the data to affect the volume, as well as the frequency and resonance of several instruments. I then panned the instrument that is being affected by the SSP1-1.9 data-set to the left and the SSP5-8.5 data-set to the right as this will be the orientation when they are placed side by side. I was then able to use the same data to affect the visuals. I posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwvKa5zofSs" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> of my visuals and audio compiled together in order to show the studio. The video is limited in its resolution quality as this was just a trial run to begin to get an idea of how the visuals and audio will relate to each other.

            <br>
            Due to current COVID restrictions I have rethought the importance of an online representation of the work. This is the same issue many galleries and museums have also faced throughout the crisis, the solution that I find most interesting is the virtual environment. A good example of this is <a href="https://shutdown.gallery/" target="_blank">SHUTDOWN.gallery</a>, a virtual gallery that provides a digital space for a visual experience. The website allows the user to walk around a gallery space, viewing the artwork on the wall. I hope to achieve something similar, with my digital space also acting as a starting point for people to learn more about climate change and what they can do. This way I will be able to give my audience more of a call to action than what was previously possible.

            <p>In the studio this week we were able to gather some feedback from the other students. The questions I asked were related to their understanding of the work as well as initial reactions. Most people were able to understand the context of the work, however, some people were unable to specifically notice the data-sources. I feel this is caused by the low-res video, as well as the graphics not prominently showing the data / years. This issue will be magnified when the videos are placed on an angle next to each other in my virtual world. I will need to fix that by making that information more dominant in the visual hierarchy.

            During the week I began to build the virtual world in <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>. Unity is an open-source game engine but is also used for art and virtual reality platforms. I have some previous experience with Unity so I was able to quickly experiment with the how I will position the videos besides each other in a 3D world.

For my Capstone project I worked with my brother and continued the philosophy of work I came to understand in the Agents of Change studio, that being the realisation of the social responsibility of the designer and their ability to make change. Our capstone project was a research-led, web-based virtual experience exploring Australia’s relationship with immigration.
